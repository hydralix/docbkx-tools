#summary Explains how to setup maven to use snapshot and stable releases of docbkx-tools

= Stable releases =
Our public repository is synchronized with the maven central repository (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/agilejava/docbkx/) so you should have no extra configuration in your pom.xml (or settings.xml) to declare our repository.

However if you really need our public repository you can use the following statement:

{{{
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>docbkx.snapshots</id>
    <name>Maven Plugin Snapshots</name>
    <url>http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/repository/</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
}}} 

= Snapshot releases =

Before making a public stable release with a number of new functionalities or bug corrections we often make intermediate unstable releases. In the maven way of life these unstable releases are called snapshots (you will notice a *-SNAPSHOT* appended after the version numbers).

Snapshot release artifacts are not accessible through the Maven Central Repository thus you will need to modify your maven configuration (pom.xml or settings.xml)

You can use the following statement:

{{{
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>docbkx.snapshots</id>
    <name>Maven Plugin Snapshots</name>
    <url>http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
}}}
