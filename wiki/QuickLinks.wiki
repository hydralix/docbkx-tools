#summary External (not hosted on googlecode) documentation links.

Most of the external documentation is hosted on the docbkx-tools SourceForge project (http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/).

You will especially notice the following documentations:
* [http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/docbkx-samples/manual.html User guide]
* [http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/advanced.html Advanced customization]
* [http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/builder.html Super advanced customization]

In addition of the previous Advanced customization page a new feature has been added allowing to link to every XSL files of the original docbook release.
It can be done using same kind of syntax as *<xsl:import
href="urn:docbkx:stylesheet"/>* (which points to the main docbook XSL file) by appending */filetolink.xsl*. Here is an example allowing to import inline.xsl: *<xsl:import
href="urn:docbkx:stylesheet/inline.xsl"/>*
