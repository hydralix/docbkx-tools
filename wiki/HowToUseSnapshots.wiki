#summary Explains how to setup maven to use snapshot releases of docbkx-tools.

= Introduction =

Before making a public stable release with a number of new functionalities or bug corrections we often make intermediate unstable releases. In the maven way of life these unstable releases are called snapshots (you will notice a *-SNAPSHOT* appended after the version numbers).

Snapshot release artifacts are not accessible through the Maven Central Repository thus you will need to modify your maven configuration (pom.xml or settings.xml)

= What =

{{{
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>docbkx.snapshots</id>
    <name>Maven Plugin Snapshots</name>
    <url>http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
}}}



= How =

Just have a look at the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-testing-development-plugins.html dedicated] maven site page.
