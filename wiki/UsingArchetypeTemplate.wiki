#summary Describes how to use the docbkx-quickstart-archetype

= Introduction =

A maven archetype is a template system to initialize a new maven project. It allows you to quick start as a default layout and additional files (with meaning for the current project) are created.

*docbkx-quickstart-archetype* creates a default project with:
 * a pom.xml file already configured
 * a sample docbook document
 * a docbook stylesheet customization for fop
 * a plugin execution to generate a pdf file

= How to use =

If you don't have nay docbkx-tools plugins already installed in your locale maven repository (2.0.10-SNAPSHOT +) you will have to use the following command line to initialize a project:

{{{
mvn archetype:create 
  -DgroupId=[your group id]
  -DartifactId=[your artifact id]
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.agilejava.docbkx
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=docbkx-quickstart-archetype
  -DarchetypeVersion=2.0.10-SNAPSHOT
  -DremoteRepositories=http://docbkx-tools.sourceforge.net/snapshots/
}}}

If everything runs fine you should have your project.

Now enter you project and run `mvn pre-site` to start the preconfigured execution.

_As for now only 2.0.10-SNAPSHOT supports the archetype feature, so you will also need to add our snapshot repository to either the generated pom.xml or within you $home/setting.xml - Have a look at HowToUseRepositories for more information about this_
